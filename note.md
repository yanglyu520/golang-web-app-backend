Left to do:
1. Add the diagram to how net package work for tcp server
2. Add a diagram for api gateway to lamda to RDS in AWS architect diagram

- understand even better and clearer idea of the tcp 3 handshakes
- good to understand the http 1.0 vs 2.0 vs 3.0
- understand more on the apigateway
- understand better with the microservices
