## Exercise 1: play with postman
- learning why we use postman
- learning different usage to test API with postman

## Exercise 2: code a tcp server

## Exercise 3: code a http handler

- return the url
- Return the request method
- Write a hello world page

## Exercise 4: code a multiplexer

## Exercise 5: connect db to webapp
- download postgres and install
if you just get the latest install package and just do the default options it should set up a server on your machine.
- the postgres installer should create an app on your machine called "pgadmin" that you can use to run SQL on your server
so you can use that to create a table

- you can create a simple table
- You can get your little web service that we made in Golang to actually query a row in that table, and return the contents as the response body

## Exercise 6: work with AWS, put web app in AWS Lambda
- create a s3 bucket in AWS and put a text, retrieve the text from ur local go web app
